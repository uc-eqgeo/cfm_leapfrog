# Introduction
Welcome. This online documentation is intended to walk users through the steps described in Howell et al. (in review). That paper focusses more on the rationale for each step in the workflow, whereas here we focus on the computational steps required to implement the workflow. 

Please do get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.
