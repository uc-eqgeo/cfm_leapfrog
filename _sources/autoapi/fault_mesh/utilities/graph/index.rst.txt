.. py:function:: connected_nodes(node_list)

   Find all connected components in a graph created from node lists.

   :param node_list: Lists of nodes where each list represents a path or chain of connected nodes
   :type node_list: List[List[str]]
   :return: List of sets, where each set contains nodes that are connected to each other
   :rtype: list[set]


.. py:function:: suggest_combined_name(connected_node_set)

   Suggest a combined name for a set of connected nodes.

   This function analyzes a set of connected node names and attempts to find
   a meaningful combined name based on common elements or patterns in the names.

   :param connected_node_set: A set of node names that are connected in a graph
   :type connected_node_set: list
   :return: A suggested name for the combined nodes
   :rtype: str
