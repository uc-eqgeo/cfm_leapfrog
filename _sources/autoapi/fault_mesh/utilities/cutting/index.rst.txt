Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: cut(line, distance)

   Cuts a line in two at a distance from its starting point

   :param line: The line to cut
   :type line: LineString
   :param distance: The distance along the line at which to cut
   :type distance: float
   :return: Two LineString objects representing the portions of the line before and after the cut
   :rtype: tuple[LineString, LineString]


.. py:function:: cut_line_at_point(line, point)

   Cuts a line in two at a specified point

   :param line: The line to cut
   :type line: LineString
   :param point: The point at which to cut the line
   :type point: Point
   :return: Two LineString objects representing the portions of the line before and after the cut
   :rtype: tuple[LineString, LineString]


.. py:function:: cut_line_at_multiple_points(line, points)

   Cuts a line at multiple points and returns all resulting segments.

   :param line: The line to cut
   :type line: LineString
   :param points: List of points at which to cut the line
   :type points: List[Point]
   :return: List of LineString objects representing the segments of the cut line
   :rtype: List[LineString]


.. py:function:: cut_line_between_two_points(line, points)

   Cuts a line between two points and returns the segment between them.

   :param line: The line to cut
   :type line: LineString
   :param points: List of two points at which to cut the line
   :type points: List[Point]
   :return: LineString object representing the segment between the two points
   :rtype: LineString
